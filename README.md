This code uses deep learning to classify images as **sensitive** or **non-sensitive**. It employs a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with multiple layers to extract features from images and make binary predictions. The model is trained on a dataset of sensitive and non-sensitive images, using **data augmentation** to prevent overfitting. A custom callback halts training once the model reaches 98% accuracy. After training, the model's performance is evaluated, and a confusion matrix is generated. The trained model is saved and converted to **TensorFlow.js** for web deployment. Users can upload images to the model for prediction, with the model classifying them as either sensitive or non-sensitive.
